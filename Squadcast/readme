I have used the nats as publisher/subscriber.

APIServer is the external HTTP server, which run on the 5000 port.

I have deployed the service over Ec2. 

The Ec2 hosted the all the microservices and mysql db together.

EventHandler is the GRPC service.

APIServer will trigger the RPC call to EventHandler. 

EventHandler will publish the event, their are 3 Worker (Jira,Slack and Reddit) which subscriber to the following events

Jira : incident_created
Slack : query_created
Reddit : post_created


To run the nats server as service 
./gnatsd --addr 127.0.0.1 --port 4222


API Server runs on port 5000 
GRPC Server runs on port 5001 
mysql Server runs on port 3306


Entry point to the application is APIServer

APIServer has 4 end points methods.
